## Description

This is a path finder project which makes use of Dijkstra's algorithm. The project displays a graphed board where predetermined starting (top left box) and ending (bottom right box) nodes are provided. One can use their mouse anywhere on the grid, to block the route between the two nodes. Space which is blocked out on the grid are displayed as buildings. Once the user is satisfied with the areas blocked on the grid, the run algorithm button can be clicked. The pathfinder will then deploy Dijkstra's algorithm. This will quickly find the shortest path between the two given nodes. 

## Use Case
1. Digital Mapping Services in Google Maps - find the minimum distance in Google Maps, from your starting location to the nearest desired location. 
2. Social Networking Applications: Can be applied using the shortest path between users measured through handshakes or connections.
3. Telephone Networks: In a telephone network each line has a bandwidth. And the bandwidth represents the amount of information that can be transmitted by the line. Normally, the frequency of signals is higher in certain lines. So the signal is reduced by that line. Thus, the need for good bandwidth in any given location may run into the shortest distance problem.   
4. IP routing to find Open shortest Path First: Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm is widely used in the routing protocols required by the routers to update their forwarding table. The algorithm provides the shortest cost path from the source router to other routers in the network.
5. Flighting Agenda: For example, If a person needs software for making an agenda of flights for customers. The agent has access to a database with all airports and flights.
6. Designate file server: To designate a file server in a LAN(local area network), Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm can be used to minimize the number of ‚Äúhops‚Äù from the file server to every other computer on the network.
7. AI Robotics: The drones/robots which are automated and are used to deliver the packages to a specific location or used for a task are loaded with this algorithm module so that when the source and destination is known, the robot/drone moves in the ordered direction by following the shortest path to keep delivering the package in a minimum amount of time.

## Available Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

### `Right-CLick and Hold"`,

The app is built to respond to right-Click and hold on a mouse this creates and removes buildings

### `"Run ALgorithm"`,

Click on the Button Run Algorithm  CSS3 animations will run as a route is being searched for. 

### `"Clear Board"`: ,

Resets the Board.
